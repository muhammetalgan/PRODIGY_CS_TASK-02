# Image Encryption/Decryption

This Python program encrypts images using the AES encryption algorithm and then performs key exchange with RSA. It also decrypts encrypted images by performing inverse operations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` module (usually comes with Python)
- `Pillow` module (can be installed with `pip install Pillow`)
- `cryptography` module (can be installed with `pip install cryptography`)

## Usage

1. Run the program (`python image_encryption_decryption.py`).
2. Click the "Encrypt Image" button to select and encrypt an image.
3. Decrypt the encrypted image with the "Decrypt Image" button.
